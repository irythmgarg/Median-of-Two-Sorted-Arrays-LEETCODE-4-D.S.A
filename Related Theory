// Problem Statement:
// Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, find the median of the two sorted arrays.
// The overall run-time complexity should be O(log(min(m, n))).

// Theory:
// The median of an array is the middle element when the array is sorted (if the size is odd) or the average of the two middle elements (if the size is even).
// The goal is to merge the two arrays conceptually and find the median without explicitly merging them, 
// using binary search to optimize the process.

// Time Complexity:
// O(log(min(m, n))) - Binary search is applied on the smaller of the two arrays.

// Space Complexity:
// O(1) - No additional space is used apart from a few variables.
